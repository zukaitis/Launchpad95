# Launchpad95g

[Launchpad95](http://motscousus.com/stuff/2011-07_Novation_Launchpad_Ableton_Live_Scripts/) Ableton script with additional functionality for [midi-grid](https://github.com/zukaitis/midi-grid) controller

This script is edited specifically to work with [midi-grid](https://github.com/zukaitis/midi-grid) DIY controller, so it's not likely to function properly with any of Novation Launchpad controllers.

Changes over original [Launchpad95](http://motscousus.com/stuff/2011-07_Novation_Launchpad_Ableton_Live_Scripts/) script:
* does not check result of device challenge
* transmits names of current Track and Clip over SysEx MIDI messages, so this info could be displayed on controller's LCD screen
